# Astrograph
A typeface inspired by the lettering on Starfleet vessels.

Throughout the Star Trek franchise, a handful of typeface families have been used for the name and registration numbers displayed on the hulls of Starfleet starships. One of the most recognizable and commonly used is based on Aldo Novarese's Microgramma, which was originally designed in 1952.

Over time, several typefaces have been derived from Microgramma and used to adorn Star Trek ships. These include Novarese's own Eurostile, which is an expanded and refined take on Microgramma, and the franchise's Millennium (formerly known as Starfleet Bold Extended), which features offset outlines and alternative forms for certain characters.

The Astrograph typeface project aims to combine the refined midcentury look of Microgramma and Eurostile with the letterform improvements of Millennium. Users will have the option to choose whether to include or omit the offset outline.
