# Astrograph
A typeface inspired by the lettering on Starfleet vessels.

The Star Trek franchise has historically used a handfull of typeface families for the name & registration numbers emblazoned on the hulls of Starfleet starships. The most common and easily-recognizable of these are perhaps the ones based on Aldo Novarese's _Microgramma_, designed in 1952.

Several typefaces have since been derived from Microgramma and have likewise been used to adorn the ships of Star Trek. These include Novarese's own _Eurostile_, an expanded and refined take on Microgramma, as well as the Star Trek franchise's _Millennium_ (formerly _Starfleet Bold Extended_), with its offset outlines and alternate forms for certain characters.

With Astrograph I wanted to create a version of these fonts that combines the refined, midcentury look of Microgramma and Eurostile with the letterform improvements of Millennium, and that gives the user an option of keeping the offset outline or leaving it out.
